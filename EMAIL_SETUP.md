# Email Functionality Setup

## Overview
The application now includes automatic email confirmation functionality that sends a beautifully formatted confirmation email to users when their business formation order is successfully processed.

## Features
- ‚úÖ Automatic email sending on successful order completion
- ‚úÖ Professional HTML email template with branding
- ‚úÖ Order details, contact information, and next steps
- ‚úÖ Responsive design that works on all devices
- ‚úÖ Error handling to prevent email failures from affecting order processing

## Email Configuration
The email service is configured using environment variables. Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.titan.email
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_SECURE=true
EMAIL_USER=noreply@zoxxo.io
EMAIL_PASS=Zoxxo@2022
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@zoxxo.io

# Logo Configuration
LOGO_URL=https://launchmybiz.net/mainlogo-3-2.png
```

**Current Configuration:**
- **Host:** smtp.titan.email
- **Port:** 465 (SSL)
- **Email:** noreply@zoxxo.io
- **Password:** Zoxxo@2022

## Email Template Features
The confirmation email includes:
- üéâ Success confirmation header
- üì¶ Package details (name, filing speed, total amount)
- üë§ Contact information
- üè¢ Company information
- üìã Next steps in the process
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Important notes and contact information

## How It Works
1. When a Stripe webhook receives a `checkout.session.completed` event
2. The system processes the payment and saves the business data
3. An email is automatically sent to the customer's email address
4. The email includes all relevant order details and next steps

## Testing
To test the email functionality, run:
```bash
node test-email.js
```

**Important:** Change the test email address in `test-email.js` before running the test.

## Error Handling
- Email failures are logged but don't prevent order processing
- The system continues to work even if email sending fails
- All email errors are logged for debugging

## Security Notes
- ‚úÖ Email credentials are now stored in environment variables
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded credentials in the source code
- ‚úÖ Secure configuration for production deployment
- Make sure your `.env` file is in `.gitignore` to prevent committing secrets

## Troubleshooting
If emails are not being sent:
1. Check the console logs for error messages
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly in `.env` file
3. Ensure SMTP credentials are correct
4. Check if the email address is valid
5. Verify network connectivity and firewall settings
6. Test SMTP connection with the provided credentials

## Future Enhancements
- Add email templates for different order statuses
- Implement email tracking and analytics
- Add support for multiple email providers
- Create email preference management for users
